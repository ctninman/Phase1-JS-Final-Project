# My Top Ten Albums

JavaScript Project

## Overview

Users search the Itunes API by albums terms or by artist terms for albums to add to their Top Ten. Each album has a spot for a ten word comment about why the user loves that album. Other users can add suggestions for similar albums that they think the user may enjoy as well.

*Current version does not have any password system set up, so any one can make changes to a user's data if they enter the username.*

## Enter userName

If a user name has not been entered, there is a prompt to create or enter a user id. If a user with that name exists, there information will be loaded. If no user exists with that name, a new user database will be created.

## Search for Albums

There is a search bar near the top of the page which search the Itunes Store API. Using Search Artists will perform a search based on artist terms. Using Search Albums will perform a search based on album terms.

## Add Album to Top Ten

For each album rendered in the search display, a user can click on the album and a number form will appear. Users can select a number from 1-10, and the album will be added to their database at that ranking, and it will be rendered on the page.

## Add Comment about Album

Users can add a comment about each album in their Top Ten. Comments must be ten words long, to match the theme of Top Ten *(top ten words for your top ten albums)*. That comment will be added to the user database and displayed underneath the album. Users can remove the comment.

## Add Suggestion - Other User

Another user can enter their name and album from the current user's list, and then recommend another album that they think the user should check out.
